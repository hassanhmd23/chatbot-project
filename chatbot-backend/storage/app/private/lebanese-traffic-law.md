4. The overtaking driver must return immediately to their right lane after ensuring that it is possible to do so without any prohibition.

#### Article 30:

1. Drivers intending to be overtaken must immediately adhere to the far right of the road without increasing the speed of their vehicles.
2. In situations where the shape or condition of the roadway or the free space of its width does not permit meeting or overtaking easily and safely, drivers of vehicles whose width or the width of their load exceeds two meters or whose length exceeds seven meters must, if necessary, stop or pull aside to facilitate the passage of smaller vehicles.
3. In the same situations, if a vehicle of the armed forces, fire brigade, civil defense, or ambulance signals its approach, other road users must pull aside and reduce their speed, and if necessary stop, to facilitate the passage of these vehicles.
4. On mountain roads or roads with steep slopes, where meeting is difficult or impossible, the driver of the vehicle going downhill must stop first and pull their vehicle aside to allow passage for the vehicle going uphill.
5. If meeting necessitates performing a reversing operation, reversing is mandatory on the drivers of:
    - A single vehicle facing a group of vehicles.
    - A light vehicle facing a heavy vehicle.
